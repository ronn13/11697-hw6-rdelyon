Curate a set of at least 100 QA pairs and 50 supporting documents. Your main target questions are the ones that models cannot answer without retrieval.
You can manually create all of them or synthesize them with LLMs.

Requirement:
Include the following question types at least 20 QA pairs for each: multiple choice, factoid (words/short phrase), list (multiple possible answers/instructions)
Try to create questions that cannot be answered without retrieval, as much as possible.
Create a diverse set of questions so that they need as many distinct documents as possible in your document collection.
Deliverable:
Create a data folder, data, and put the following files, data/question.tsv, data/answer.tsv, data/evidence.tsv, and your supporting documents under data/corpus/*

Format:
question.tsv (one question per line)

<question 1>\t<question type>
answer.tsv (tab-separated answers, each line for the corresponding question)

<anwer 1-1>\t<answer 1-2>\t...
evidence.tsv

<original url 1>\t<filename 1>
Files under data/corpus/ can be of any type, e.g., .txt, .pdf, .md, etc.
