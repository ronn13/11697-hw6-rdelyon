        "In this task, you will curate a set of questions and build two LangChain QA pipelines, one with RAG and one without. For the RAG pipeline, you will index a set of documents that improve model performance on your questions. Therefore you should experiment to find questions about your chosen topic that can't be answered well by the model without RAG.\n",
        "\n",
        "By default, the retriever k = 1; you can set this to any value that works well with your chosen questions / corpus.\n",

        "Before beginning, **please read through the entire notebook** and let us know right away if you have questions (post on Piazza).\n",
