Abdulrazak Gurnah was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2021 'for his uncompromising and compassionate penetration of the effects of colonialism and the fate of the refugee in the gulf between cultures and continents.' Born in Zanzibar in 1948, Gurnah arrived in England as a refugee in the late 1960s following the Zanzibar Revolution. He became a professor at the University of Kent, where he taught postcolonial literature. His novels include 'Memory of Departure' (1987), 'Pilgrim's Way' (1988), 'Dottie' (1990), 'Paradise' (1994, shortlisted for the Booker Prize), 'Admiring Silence' (1996), 'By the Sea' (2001, longlisted for the Booker), 'Desertion' (2005), 'The Last Gift' (2011), 'Gravel Heart' (2017), and 'Afterlives' (2020). His work explores themes of displacement, memory, identity, and the lasting impact of colonialism on individuals and communities. The Swedish Academy noted his 'emotional compass' and praised his ability to avoid cultural stereotypes while illuminating the devastating effects of colonialism on East African societies.
