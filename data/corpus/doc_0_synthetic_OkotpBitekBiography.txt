Okot p'Bitek (1931-1982) was a prominent Ugandan poet, novelist, and anthropologist born in Gulu, northern Uganda. He studied at King's College Budo, Government Training College Mbarara, Bristol University, and Oxford University where he earned a BLitt in social anthropology. His most famous work, 'Song of Lawino' (1966), written originally in Acholi and later translated to English, became one of the most widely read literary works in Africa. The poem presents a cultural clash between traditional African values and Western modernization through the voice of Lawino, a rural Acholi woman whose husband Ocol has adopted Western ways. p'Bitek's other notable works include 'Song of Ocol' (1970), 'Song of a Prisoner' (1971), and 'Song of Malaya' (1971). He also wrote novels such as 'White Teeth' and scholarly works on African religions and oral literature. p'Bitek served as Director of the National Theatre and National Cultural Centre in Uganda and taught at universities in Nairobi and Makerere.
