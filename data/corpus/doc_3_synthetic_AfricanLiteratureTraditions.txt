The oral tradition remains fundamental, with storytelling serving educational, entertainment, and cultural preservation functions. Written African literature gained prominence during and after colonialism, with authors using colonial languages to voice African perspectives. Key themes include colonialism, independence, identity, and social justice. Contemporary African literature is flourishing with works in multiple languages, addressing globalization, technology, and modern African experiences. The continent has produced Nobel laureates and internationally celebrated writers.
