rates the
stereotypical view of stepmothers, but also portrays the immensely strong
bonds in Maasai culture between brothers and age-mates. (Compare the Luhya
equivalent, Kalisanga and Kaliyeto.)
The Girls of the Knee, which highlights the
burdens of wives and mothers, could also serve as a warning to men who
abuse their wives. 
A Woman's Prayer Song is a lament sung by childless
women. It expresses the sorry state of (supposedly) barren women in Maasai
society, their sorrow and their pain. The "branches" in line 3 are for
the fence around the homestead. The "water" (in line 4) is carried home
daily. While nursing a baby women allow their hair to grow: instead of
being washed it is greased. And when the child is weaned its mother's head
is again shaved -- using milk in place of water. Pregnant women are given
choice cuts of meat normally reserved for warriors.
Why People Have to Dig is another tale that
blames women for their own misfortune. Bunyore is close to Kakamega.
Why Zebras Have Stripes is a "Why Story" explaining
the inexplicable.
The story of Kalisanga and Kaliteyo parallels
that of "Two Brothers Who Were Friends". Elephant and Hare demonstrate that "brain is
superior to brawn".
