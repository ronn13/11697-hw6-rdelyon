Meja Mwangi (born 1948) is a Kenyan novelist known for his gritty portrayals of urban life and social realism. His breakthrough novel 'Kill Me Quick' (1973) depicts Nairobi's street children and urban poverty with unflinching honesty. 'Going Down River Road' (1976), considered his masterpiece, follows a day in the life of an alcoholic construction worker, exploring themes of economic exploitation and urban alienation in post-independence Kenya. 'The Cockroach Dance' (1979) continues his examination of marginalized urban dwellers. Mwangi also wrote about Kenya's independence struggle in 'Carcase for Hounds' (1974) and 'Taste of Death' (1975). His later works include 'The Last Plague' (2000), a thriller about bioterrorism, and 'The Big Chiefs' (2008). Mwangi's writing style is characterized by vivid descriptions, dark humor, and social critique. Unlike writers who focused on rural settings or political allegory, Mwangi brought attention to the harsh realities of urban poverty, unemployment, and the disillusionment of Kenya's working class. His novels won multiple awards including the Jomo Kenyatta Prize for Literature.
