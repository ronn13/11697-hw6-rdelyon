Barbara Kimenye (1929-2012) was a pioneering Ugandan children's author and journalist, best known for her 'Moses' series of children's books. Born in England to a Ugandan Baganda father and English mother, she grew up in Uganda and became one of the first African writers to create widely popular children's literature. Her Moses books, starting with 'Moses' (1968), feature a mischievous schoolboy and were among the first children's books by an African author to gain international recognition. The series includes over a dozen titles such as 'Moses and Mildred,' 'Moses in Trouble,' and 'Moses and the School Farm.' Kimenye's straightforward prose and relatable characters made her books accessible to young African readers while avoiding the condescension often found in colonial-era children's literature. She also wrote for adults, including the collection 'Kalasanda' (1965) and 'Kalasanda Revisited' (1966), humorous stories about village life. She worked as a journalist for various publications and contributed to establishing a distinctly African voice in children's literature.
