Penina Mlama (formerly Penina Muhando, born 1948) is a Tanzanian playwright, academic, and cultural activist, widely recognized as Tanzania's leading playwright writing in Swahili. Her plays address social issues including gender inequality, corruption, and cultural change. 'Hatia' (Guilt, 1972), her first play, explored justice and morality. 'Heshima Yangu' (My Respect, 1974) examined women's rights and dignity. 'Pambo' (1975) critiqued superficial modernization and cultural alienation. 'Lina Ubani' (There is Medicine, 1984) addressed women's oppression and the need for social transformation. Muhando's work is notable for incorporating traditional African performance elements, including song, dance, and audience participation, challenging Western theatrical conventions. She has been instrumental in developing Swahili-language theater as a vehicle for social commentary and cultural preservation. As a professor at the University of Dar es Salaam, she trained generations of playwrights and theater practitioners. Her scholarly work on African theater, oral traditions, and performance has been influential internationally. Muhando received numerous awards including the Noma Award for Publishing in Africa and has been recognized as a pioneer in African women's theater.
