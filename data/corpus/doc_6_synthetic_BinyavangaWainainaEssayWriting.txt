Binyavanga Wainaina (1971-2019) was a Kenyan author, journalist, and activist whose satirical essay 'How to Write About Africa' (2005) became one of the most influential pieces of African literary criticism. Published in Granta, the essay mockingly outlined stereotypes Western writers use when depicting Africa: starving children, wise elders, exotic wildlife, corruption, and violence. His sharp wit exposed how Africa is often portrayed as a monolithic entity rather than a diverse continent with complex societies. Wainaina's memoir 'One Day I Will Write About This Place' (2011) won the Windham-Campbell Prize and chronicled his childhood in Kenya and journey to becoming a writer. He won the Caine Prize for African Writing in 2002 for his story 'Discovering Home.' As founding editor of the literary magazine Kwani?, Wainaina provided a platform for emerging African writers and promoted new African voices. In 2014, he publicly came out as gay, becoming one of the most prominent LGBTQ+ activists in Africa. His work challenged Western narratives about Africa while also critiquing African societies, always with incisive humor and profound insight.
