Ugandan literature flourished following independence in 1962, though political turmoil under Idi Amin (1971-1979) and subsequent conflicts significantly impacted literary production. Okot p'Bitek's 'Song of Lawino' (1966) set the tone for post-independence critique, challenging both colonialism and uncritical adoption of Western values. During Amin's brutal regime, many writers fled into exile, including writers like Okello Oculi and Taban lo Liyong. The return to relative stability in the 1980s saw renewed literary activity. Moses Isegawa's 'Abyssinian Chronicles' (1998), written in Dutch exile, provided a panoramic view of Uganda's turbulent post-independence history. Jennifer Makumbi's 'Kintu' (2014) wove together centuries of Ugandan history through multiple generations of one family. Contemporary Ugandan literature addresses dictatorship, conflict, and recovery, while also exploring contemporary urban life, sexuality, and identity. Kakwenza Rukirabasaija's satirical novels have challenged current government policies, resulting in persecution. Women writers like Doreen Baingana and Beatrice Lamwaka have brought new perspectives to Ugandan literature. The literary scene includes poetry, with writers like Susan Kiguli and Beverley Nambozo Nsengiyunva gaining recognition, and a growing number of young writers publishing through digital platforms and small presses.
