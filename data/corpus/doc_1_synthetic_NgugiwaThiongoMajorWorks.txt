Ngugi wa Thiong'o, born James Ngugi in 1938 in Limuru, Kenya, is one of Africa's most celebrated authors. His early novels written in English include 'Weep Not, Child' (1964), his first novel exploring the Mau Mau rebellion through a child's eyes; 'The River Between' (1965), set in the Gikuyu communities during early colonial contact; and 'A Grain of Wheat' (1967), examining Kenya's independence. His most politically charged work, 'Petals of Blood' (1977), critiques post-independence Kenya's neocolonialism and led to his imprisonment without trial in 1977. While detained, he wrote 'Devil on the Cross' on toilet paper, his first novel in Gikuyu language. After his release and exile, Ngugi renounced English and committed to writing in African languages. His later works include 'Matigari' (1986), 'Wizard of the Crow' (2006), and the memoir trilogy 'Dreams in a Time of War,' 'In the House of the Interpreter,' and 'Birth of a Dream Weaver.' He has been a perennial Nobel Prize candidate.
